  mkrootfs was originally create in 2008 by Bertrand Quenault (Paris, FR) under
 a more primitive form that only generated live system based on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

  This initial version was designed to provide the triplet of parts necessary
 to boot Linux (kernel, initrd and filesystem image) and PXELINUX configuration
 file associated.
